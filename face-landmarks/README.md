## Explanation
This React component sets up a webcam feed using the `react-webcam` library and processes the video stream using the MediaPipe Pose Detection API (`@mediapipe/pose`). It detects human poses in real-time and draws keypoint landmarks and connections on a canvas overlay.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository_url]`
